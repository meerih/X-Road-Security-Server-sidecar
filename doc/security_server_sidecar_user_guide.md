# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Target Audience
The intended audience of this User Guide are X-Road Security Server system administrators responsible for installing and using X-Road Security Server Sidecar software.

The document is intended for readers with a moderate knowledge of Linux server management, computer networks, Docker and X-Road.

# 2 Installation
## 2.1 Prerequisites to Installation
The X-Road Security Server Sidecar installation requires an existing installation of Docker.
Operating systems:
- MacOS
- Linux
- Windows

Building with Docker BuildKit can slightly reduce the size of the resulting container image.
See <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/> for more information.

## 2.2 X-Road Security Server Sidecar images
The Security Server Sidecar has four different images with alternative configurations. Each Security Server version number (e.g., 6.24.0, 6.25.0, etc.) has its own set of images.

**Image**                                                | **Description**                               
------------------------------------------------------------ | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:&lt;version&gt;-slim      | This is the base image of the Security Server Sidecar with the minimum required packages and configuration to function.
niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:&lt;version&gt;           | This image uses the slim as the base image and includes the packages that support [environmental monitoring](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/EnvironmentalMonitoring/Monitoring-architecture.md), [operational monitoring](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/tree/develop/doc/OperationalMonitoring) and [message logging](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/DataModels/dm-ml_x-road_message_log_data_model.md).
niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:&lt;version&gt;-slim-fi   | This image is the same as the niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:&lt;version&gt;-slim but with the Finnish settings configuration included.
niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:&lt;version&gt;-fi        | This image is the same as the niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:&lt;version&gt; but with the Finnish settings configuration included.

All of the images can act as a provider or consumer Security Servers, but some of the images have less features available. The images with a country code suffix (e.g., `-fi`) come with a country-specific configuration. The images without a country code suffix come with the X-Road default configuration.

**Feature**                      | **Sidecar** | **Sidecar Slim** | 
---------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
Consume services                 | Yes         | Yes              |
Provide services                 | Yes         | Yes              |       
Message logging                  | Yes         | No               |                  
Environmental monitoring         | Yes         | No               |          
Operational monitoring           | Yes         | No               |

1.17   |                                           | Public IP address, NAT address for Security Server Sidecar

To protect the Security Server from unwanted access it is strongly recommended to use a firewall (hardware- or software-based). The firewall can be applied to both incoming and outgoing connections, depending on the security requirements of the environment where the Security Server will be deployed. It is recommended to allow incoming traffic to specific ports only from explicitly defined sources using IP filtering. **Special attention should be paid with the firewall configuration since incorrect configuration may leave the Security Server vulnerable to exploits and attacks**.

## 2.4 Requirements for the X-Road Security Server Sidecar
Minimum recommended Docker engine configuration to run the Security Server Sidecar container:
- CPUs: 2
- Memory: 2 GiB
- Swap: 1 GiB
- Disk space: 2 GiB
- If the Security Server is separated from other networks by a firewall and/or NAT, the necessary connections to and from the Security Server need to be allowed (**reference data: 1.12; 1.13; 1.14; 1.15;**). The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) are outside the scope of this guide.
- if the Security Server has a private IP address, a corresponding NAT record must be created in the firewall (**reference data: 1.18**).

## 2.5 Network
The table below lists the required connections between different components.

**Connection Type** | **Source** | **Target** | **Target Ports** | **Protocol** | **Note** |
-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
Out | Security Server | Central Server | 80, 4001 | tcp | |
Out | Security Server | Management Security Server | 5500, 5577 | tcp | |
Out | Security Server | OCSP Service | 80 / 443 | tcp | |
Out | Security Server | Timestamping Service | 80 / 443 | tcp | |

Out | Security Server | Producer Information System | 80, 443, other | tcp | Target in the internal network |
In  | Monitoring Security Server | Security Server | 5500, 5577 | tcp | |
In  | Data Exchange Partner Security Server (Service Consumer) | Security Server | 5500, 5577 | tcp | |
In | Consumer Information System | Security Server | 80, 443 | tcp | Source in the internal network |
In | Admin | Security Server | &lt;ui port&gt; (**reference data 1.2**) | tcp | Source in the internal network |

## 2.6 Installation
To install X-Road Security Server Sidecar we can run the script `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` which will build and run the image. Alternatively one of the images published on Dockerhub can be used. Both methods result in the same running container.

### 2.6.1 Installation using setup script

To install the Security Server Sidecar in a local development environment, run the script `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` providing the parameters in the order shown (reference data in user guide 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4):

  ```bash
  ./setup_security_server_sidecar.sh <name of the Sidecar container> <admin UI port> <software token PIN code> <admin username> <admin password> (<remote database server hostname> <remote database server port> <remote_database_name>)
  ```

The script `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` will:

- Create a Docker bridge-type network called xroad-network to provide container-to-container communication.
- Build xroad-sidecar-security-server-image performing the following configuration steps:
  - Downloads and installs the packages xroad-proxy, xroad-addon-metaservices, xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator and xroad-autologin from the public NIIS artifactory repository (version bionic-6.23.0 or later).
  - Removes the generated serverconf database and properties files (to be re-generated in the initial configuration script).
  - Removes the default admin username (to be re-generated in the initial configuration script).
  - Removes the generated internal and proxy-ui-api certificates (to be re-generated in the initial configuration script).
  - Enables health check port and interfaces (by default all available interfaces).
  - Backs up the read-only xroad packages' configuration to allow Security Server Sidecar configuration updates.
  - Copies the Security Server Sidecar custom configuration files.
  - Exposes the container ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 4000 (admin UI), 5500 (proxy), 5577 (proxy OCSP) and 5588 (proxy health check).
- Start a new Security Server Sidecar container from the xroad-sidecar-security-server-image and execute the initial configuration script, which will perform the following configuration steps:
  - Maps ports 4000 (admin UI) and 80 (HTTP) to user-defined ones (reference data 1.2).
  - Maps port 5588 (proxy health check) to the same host port.
  - Updates Security Server Sidecar configuration on startup if the installed version of the image has been updated.
  - Configures xroad-autologin custom software token PIN code with user-supplied PIN (reference data 1.3).
  - Configures admin credentials with user-supplied username and password (reference data 1.4).
  - Generates new internal and admin UI TLS keys and self-signed certificates to establish a secure connection with the client information system.
  - Recreates serverconf database and properties file with serverconf username and random password.
  - Optionally configures the Security Server Sidecar to use an external database server.
  - Starts Security Server Sidecar services.
  - Replace `initctl` for `supervisorctl` in `xroad_restore.sh` for starting and stopping the services.
  - Create sidecar-config directory on the host and mount it into the /etc/xroad config directory on the container.

Note (1): The installation using the setup script will only be available for linux systems, in case of Windows or Mac we should install it using the [dockerhub image](#262-installation-using-dockerhub-image).

#### 2.6.1.1 Security Server Sidecar Slim
To install the Security Server Sidecar slim, modify the Docker image build path in the `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` script by changing the path `sidecar/Dockerfile` to `sidecar/slim/Dockerfile`. The Sidecar is a slim version of the sidecar who does not include support for message logging and monitoring.
To install the Security Server Sidecar slim with Finnish settings, modify the Docker image build path in the `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` script by changing the path `sidecar/Dockerfile` to `sidecar/slim/fi/Dockerfile`

#### 2.6.1.2 Finnish settings
  To install the Security Server Sidecar in a local development environment with Finnish settings, modify the image build in the `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` changing the path "sidecar/Dockerfile" to "sidecar/fi/Dockerfile"

### 2.6.2 Installation using Dockerhub image
First, create a Docker network to allow communication between containers, we can run the Docker command:
```
docker network inspect xroad-network >/dev/null 2>&1 || docker network create -d bridge xroad-network
```
To install the Security Server Sidecar in a local development environment, we can run the Docker command (**reference data: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11**):
```
docker run --detach -p <ui port>:4000 -p <http port>:80 -p 5588:5588 --network xroad-network -e XROAD_TOKEN_PIN=<token pin> -e XROAD_ADMIN_USER=<admin user> -e XROAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin password> (-e XROAD_DB_HOST=<database host> -e XROAD_DB_PORT=<database port> -e XROAD_DB_PWD=<xroad db password> -e XROAD_LOG_LEVEL=<xroad log level> -e XROAD_CONF_DATABASE_NAME=<database name>) --name <container name> niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:<image tag>
```

## 2.7 External database
It is possible to configure the Security Server Sidecar to use a remote database, instead of the default locally installed one. To do that, you need to provide the remote database server hostname and port number as arguments when running the 'setup_security_server_sidecar.sh' script in the order described below. Before running the script, you must also set the environment variable:
```
  XROAD_DB_PASSWORD
```
with the remote database administrator master password.
```
export XROAD_DB_PASSWORD=<remote database administrator master password>
./setup_security_server_sidecar.sh <name of the sidecar container> <admin UI port> <software token PIN code> <admin username> <admin password> <remote database server hostname> <remote database server port>
```

If we are using the [dockerhub image for the installation](#262-installation-using-dockerhub-image) we must fill the optional parameters in the run command (**reference data: 1.7, 1.8, 1.9**):
```
docker run ... -e XROAD_DB_HOST=<database host> -e XROAD_DB_PORT=<database port> -e XROAD_DB_PWD=<xroad db password> ...
```

The user for the connection will be the default database user `postgres`. The following configuration is needed on the remote database server to allow external access to the remote PostgreSQL database from the Security Server Sidecar:
```bash
[...]
  # - Connection Settings -

  listen_addresses = '*'  # what IP address(es) to listen on;
                          # comma-separated list of addresses;
                          # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for all
                          # (change requires restart)
  port = 5432             # (change requires restart)
[...]
```

- Edit the PostgreSQL client authentication configuration file in `pg_hba.conf` to enable connections from outside localhost. Replace the IP `127.0.0.1/32` with `0.0.0.0/0`.

```bash
[...]
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5
[...]
```

- If the database is in your local machine you have to use the interface ip that uses the host to connect to the Docker containers. You can get this ip by running the command below and checking the gateway property:
```
docker inspect <container_name>
```

- The external database has been tested both for external PostgreSQL database running in our local machine, in a remote server or inside another Docker container. It also could be integrated with AWS RDS, it has been tested for PostgreSQL engine and Aurora PostgreSQL engine (PostgreSQL version 10).

### 2.7.1 Reconfigure external database address after initialization

It is possible to change the external database after the initialization while the Sidecar container is running. This will not recreate the database, so we need to make sure that the `serverconf` database and a user with granted permissions to access it are already created. To change the database host we need to:
- Run a new command on the Sidecar container:
```bash
docker exec -it <sidecar_container_name> bash
  ```
- Inside the container open in a text editor (we can install any of the command line text editors like nano, vi ...) the `etc/xroad/db.properties` file:
 ```bash
nano etc/xroad/db.properties
  ```
- Replace the connection host, the username and password with the properties of the new database:
```bash
  [...]
    # -db.properties -
serverconf.hibernate.connection.url = jdbc:postgresql://<new_host_ip>:5432/serverconf
serverconf.hibernate.connection.username = <new_user>
serverconf.hibernate.connection.password = <new_password>
  [...]
  ```
  If other components like `message_log` or `op_monitor` are also configured in the `etc/xroad/db.properties` file to use an external database, we must change their properties in the same way as in the example above.
- In case we are using a version up to 6.24.0 we must update the admin users by editing `etc/xroad.properties` file and replace the admin users and passwords with the new ones.
```bash
[...]
  # -xroad.properties -
  serverconf.database.admin_user = <new_serverconf_admin>
  serverconf.database.admin_password = -<new_serverconf_password>
[...]
```
  If we are using the regular version of the Security Server Sidecar with the admin users for the `messagelog` and `op-monitor` databases we must the the same for this admin users.
- After the properties are changed, save and close the files  and restart the services by running:
```bash
 supervisorctl restart all
  ```

## 2.8 Logging Level

  It is possible to configure the Security Server Sidecar to adjust the logging level so that it is less verbose. To do this, we must set the environment variable XROAD_LOG_LEVEL, the value of this variable could be one of the case-sensitive string values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, ALL or OFF. By default, if the environment variable is not set, the logging level will be INFO.
  For setting the environment variable we can either edit the /etc/environment file or run:

   ```bash
    export XROAD_LOG_LEVEL=<logging level value>
    ./setup_security_server_sidecar.sh <name of the sidecar container> <admin UI port> <software token PIN code> <admin username> <admin password>
   ```

## 2.9 Volume support

It is possible to configure the Security Server Sidecar to use volume support. This will allow us to  create sidecar-config and sidecar-config-db directory on the host and mount it into the /etc/xroad and /var/lib/postgresql/10/main config directories on the container.
For adding volume support we have to modify the Docker run sentence inside the `setup_security_server_sidecar.sh` script and add the volume support:
```
-v (sidecar-config-volume-name):/etc/xroad -v (sidecar-config-db-volume-name):/var/lib/postgresql/10/main
```

For example:
```bash
[...]
docker run -v sidecar-config:/etc/xroad -v sidecar-config-db:/var/lib/postgresql/10/main -detach -p $2:4000 -p $httpport:80 -p 5588:5588 --network xroad-network -e XROAD_TOKEN_PIN=$3 -e XROAD_ADMIN_USER=$4 -e XROAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$5 -e XROAD_DB_HOST=$postgresqlhost -e XROAD_DB_PORT=$postgresqlport -e XROAD_DB_PWD=$XROAD_DB_PASSWORD --name $1 xroad-sidecar-security-server-image
[...]
```

#### 2.9.1 Store sensitive information in volumes
The file `/etc/xroad.properties` contains sensitive information to access the external database. For security reasons, it is strongly recommended to store this file outside the Security Server Sidecar container by configuring a volume:
```bash
[...]
   -v sidecar-properties:/etc/xroad.properties -detach -p $2:4000 -p $httpport:80 -p 5588:5588 --network xroad-network -e XROAD_TOKEN_PIN=$3 -e XROAD_ADMIN_USER=$4 -e XROAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$5 -e XROAD_DB_HOST=$postgresqlhost -e XROAD_DB_PORT=$postgresqlport -e XROAD_DB_PWD=$XROAD_DB_PASSWORD --name $1 xroad-sidecar-security-server-image
[...]
```

# 3 Verify installation
The installation is successful if Docker image is running, the system services are started inside the container and the user interface is responding.
- Ensure from the command line that the container is running  (**reference data: 1.1; 1.3**):
```

# 4 X-Road Security Server Sidecar initial configuration
During the Security Server initial configuration, the server‚Äôs X-Road membership information and the software token‚Äôs PIN are set

## 4.1 Prerequisites
Configuring the Security Server assumes that the Security Server owner is a member of the X-Road.

## 4.2 Reference data
ATTENTION: Reference items 2.1 - 2.3 in the reference data are provided to the Security Server owner by the X-Road central‚Äôs administrator.

**Ref** | **Value**                                               | **Explanation**
------ | -----------------------------------------                | --------------------------------------------
2.1    | &lt;global configuration anchor file&gt; or &lt;URL&gt;  | Global configuration anchor file container
2.2    | &lt;Security Server owner's member class&gt; *E.g.*  *GOV-government*; *COM - commercial*             | Member class of the Security Server's owner
2.3    | &lt;Security Server owner register code&gt;              | Member code of the Security Server's owner
2.4    | &lt;choose Security Server identificator name&gt;        | Security Server's code

Note (1): The global configuration provider's download URL and TCP port 80 must be reachable from the Security Server Sidecar network.

Note (2): Reference items 2.1 - 2.3 are provided to the Security Server owner by the X-Road Central Server's administrator.

Note (3): The Security Server member code usually refers to the organization's business code, although there can be other conventions depending on the X-Road governing authority's rules.

Note (4): The Security Server code uniquely identifies the Security Server in an X-Road instance. X-Road instance's governing authority may dictate rules on how the code should be chosen.

## 4.3 Configuration
To perform the initial configuration, open the address
```
https://SECURITYSERVER:<ui-port>/
```
in a web browser (**reference data: 1.2**). To log in, use the account name and password chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.5; 1.6**).
Upon first log-in, the system asks for the following information.
- The global configuration anchor file (**reference data: 2.1**).

 **Please verify anchor hash value with the published value.**

 If the configuration is successfully downloaded, the system asks for the following information.

 - The Security Server  owner‚Äôs member class (**reference data: 2.2**).
 - The Security Server  owner‚Äôs member code (**reference data: 2.3**).

 If the member class and member code are correctly entered, the system displays the Security Server  owner‚Äôs name as registered in the X-Road Central Server.
 - Security Server code (**reference data: 2.4**), which is chosen by the Security Server  administrator and which has to be unique across all the Security Server s belonging to the same X-Road member.
 - Software token‚Äôs PIN (**reference data: 1.4**). The PIN will be used to protect the keys stored in the software token. The PIN must be stored in a secure place, because it will be no longer possible to use or recover the private keys in the token once the PIN has been lost.

## 4.4 Security Server registration
After the Security Server Sidecar is configured, we need to register it in the Central Server, information about how to configure the Security Server Sidecar on the Central Server can be found on the  [Security Server user guide.](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ug-ss_x-road_6_security_server_user_guide.md#31-configuring-the-signing-key-and-certificate-for-the-security-server-owner)

# 5 Back up and Restore
Information of how to backup and restore the Security Server Sidecar can be found on the [Security Server User guide](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ug-ss_x-road_6_security_server_user_guide.md#13-back-up-and-restore).

The Security Server Sidecar stores its configuration in the local file system folder:
```
/etc/xroad/
```
It is possible to store this configuration outside the Docker container using Docker volumes. Adding a Docker volume will allow keeping the configuration even if the container is removed and makes it possible to use the same configuration in other Docker containers.
To add the Docker volume, in the Docker run command [docker run command](##2.6-Installation) add the Docker volume parameter mapping to the config folder:
```
docker run -v (custom-volume-name):/etc/xroad
```
Once the Docker container is running we can see the volume information and where it is stored in our local machine by running the following command:
```
docker volume inspect (custom-volume-name)
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2020-10-22T13:44:16+02:00",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/sidecar-config/_data",
        "Name": "sidecar-config",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]

```
We can manually backup the data stored in the "Mountpoint" every period of time.

## 5.1 Automatic Backups
By default the Security Server backs up its configuration automatically once every day. Backups older than 30 days are automatically removed from the server. If needed, the automatic backup policies can be adjusted by editing the `/etc/cron.d/xroad-proxy` file.
Automatic backups will be stored in the folder `/var/lib/xroad/backup/`. We can create a volume for store the automatic backups by adding in the run command:
```
docker run -v (backups-volume-name):/etc/xroad/var/lib/xroad/backup/
```

# 6 Version update
We can update the Security Server Sidecar by creating a backup, running the image with the new version, and restore the backup or reuse the volume with the xroad config ([5](# 5-Back-up-and-Restore)).
Another option, we can manually update the X-Road Sidecar packages while the Docker container is running.
To do this we must:
- From the command line open a bash terminal inside the container:
```
docker exec -it <container-name> bash
```
- Stop the services:
```
supervisorctl stop all
```
- Add the new version repository key:
```
echo "deb https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb bionic-current main" >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/xroad.list && apt-key add '/tmp/repokey.gpg'
```
- Update and upgrade the packages:
```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```
- Start the services:
```
supervisorctl start all
```

Note: It is possible that a major version update will require extra changes, for doing that check the specific documentation for the version update.

# 7 Monitoring
Monitoring will be available if we use the regular version of the X-Road Security Server Sidecar instead of the 'slim' version.
## 7.1 Environmental monitoring
Environmental monitoring for the Security Server Sidecar provider can be used to obtain information about the platform it's running on.
For example to get the system metrics:
- Create a file called **system_metrics.xml** (**reference data: 2.2;2.3;2.4**):

More information can be found in https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/master/doc/EnvironmentalMonitoring/Monitoring-architecture.md/

Note (1): The Security Server Sidecar must have available certificates and a subsystem registered on the Central Server.

## 7.2 Operational Monitoring
Operational monitoring for the Security Server Sidecar provider can be used to obtain information about the services it is running. The operational monitoring processes operational statistics (such as which services have been called, how many times, what was the size of the response, etc.) of the Security Servers. The operational monitoring will create a database named "op-monitor" for store the data, this database can be configured internally in the container or externally (check 1.6). More information about how to test it can be found here https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/tree/develop/doc/OperationalMonitoring/Protocols

# 8 Message log
Message log will be available if we use the regular version of the X-Road Security Server Sidecar instead of the 'slim' version.

## 8.1 Local storage of message log
The Security Server Sidecar periodically composes signed (and timestamped) documents from the message log data and archives them in the local file system folder:
```
/var/lib/xroad/
```
Archive files are ZIP containers containing one or more signed documents and a special linking information file for additional integrity verification purpose.

To make sure we are not running out of disk space, we can use a Docker volume to store the log records outside the container in our host.
From the docker run command [docker run command](##2.6-Installation) add the Docker volume parameter mapping to the host local storage folder for the logs:
```
docker run -v (custom-volume-name):/var/lib/xroad/  
```

# 9 Deployment options
## 9.1 General
X-Road Security Server Sidecar has multiple deployment options. The simplest choice is to have a single Security Server with a local database. This is usually fine for the majority of the cases. Nevertheless, there are other Security Server images available that can be used for tailoring the deployment to specific needs. These different images could be combined. Any of these Security Server Sidecar images can be used either as a consumer or provider role.

## 9.2 Container local database
The simplest deployment option is to use a single Security Server Sidecar container with the local database running inside the container. For development and testing purposes there is rarely the need for anything else. However, for running the Security Server Sidecar on a production environment, the requirements may be stricter.

![Security Server with local database](img/ig-ss_local_db.svg)

## 9.3 Remote database
It is possible to use a remote database with X-Road Security Server Sidecar.

X-Road Security Server Sidecar supports a variety of cloud databases including AWS RDS and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. This deployment option is useful when doing development in a cloud environment, where the use of cloud-native database is the first choice.

![Security Server with remote database](img/ig-ss_external_db.svg)

## 9.4 High Availability Setup
In production systems, it's rarely acceptable to have a single point of failure. Security Server supports provider side high-availability setup via the so-called internal load balancing mechanism. The setup works so that the same combination of <member>/<member class>/<member code>/<subsystem>/<service code> is configured on multiple Security Servers and X-Road will then route the request to the server that responds the fastest. Note that this deployment option does not provide performance benefits, just redundancy.

# 10 Kubernetes
## 10.1 Kubernetes jobs readiness, liveness and startup probes
### 10.1.1 Readiness probes
The readiness probes will perform a health check periodically in a specific time. If the health check fails, the pod will remain in a not ready state until the health check succeeds. The pod in a not ready state will be accessible through his private IP but not from the balancer and the balancer will not redirect any message to this pod. We use readiness probes instead of liveliness probes because with readiness probes we still can connect to the pod for configuring it (adding certificates...) instead of the liveliness probes that will restart the pod until the health check succeeds.

The readiness probes are useful when the pod it's not ready to serve traffic but we don't want to restart it maybe because the pod needs to be configured to be ready,  for example,  adding the certificates.

We will use the following parameters in the Kubernetes configuration file to set up the readiness probe:
 - initialDelaySeconds:  Number of seconds after the container has started before readiness probes are initiated. For this example we will use 200 seconds to have enough time for the image be downloaded and the services are ready.
 - periodSeconds:  How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
 - successThreshold: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.
 - failureThreshold:  When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up and mark the container as not ready.
 - port: Healthcheck port
 - path: Healthcheck path

  ```bash
  [...]
containers:
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /
      port: 5588
    initialDelaySeconds: 200
    periodSeconds: 30
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 1
  [...]
  ```

### 10.1.2 Liveness probes
The liveness probes are used to know when restart a container. The liveness probes will perform a health check each period of time and restart the container if it fails.

The liveness probes are useful when the pod is not in a live state and can not be accessed through the UI, for example, due to the pod being caught in a deadlock or one of the services running in the container has stopped.

The parameters for the liveness probes are the same than for the readiness probes, but using the port 80 to check if nginx is running and serving the application instead of using port 5588 to check if the Sidecar pod is ready to serve traffic. It is recommended also to increase the failureThreshold value.

  ```bash
  [...]
containers:
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
   path: /
   port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 100
  periodSeconds: 10
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 5
  [...]
  ```

### 10.1.3 Startup probes
The startup probes indicate whether the application within the container is started. All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided until it succeeds.

Startup probes are useful for Pods that have containers that take a long time to come into service. This is not really useful in the Sidecar pod because it takes to short to start.
In a different scenario where the Sidecar container would take a long time to start, the startup probe can be used in combination with the liveness probe, so that it waits until the startup probe has succeeded before starting the liveness probe. The tricky part is to set up a startup probe with the same command, HTTP or TCP check, with a failureThreshold * periodSeconds long enough to cover the worse case startup time.

 ```bash
 [...]
containers:
livenessProbe:
 httpGet:
  path: /
  port: 80
 periodSeconds: 10
 successThreshold: 1
 failureThreshold: 50
 [...]
 ```

## 10.2 Kubernetes secrets
### 10.2.1 Create secret
In this example, we are going to create a secret for the X-Road Security Server Sidecar environment variables with sensitive data.
- Create a manifest file called for example 'secret-env-variables.yaml' and fill it with the desired values of the environment variables.
- Replace <namespace_name> with the name of the namespace if it's different from `default`. If we want to use `default` namespace, we can delete the line.
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-sidecar-variables
  namespace: <namespace_name>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  XROAD_TOKEN_PIN: "1234"
  XROAD_ADMIN_USER: "xrd"
  XROAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "secret"
  XROAD_DB_HOST: "<db_host>"
  XROAD_DB_PWD: "<db_password>"
  XROAD_DB_PORT: "5432"
  XROAD_LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
```
- Apply the manifest:
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f secret-env-variables.yaml
```

### 10.2.2 Consume secret
Modify your deployment pod definition in each container that you wish to consume the secret. The key from the Secret becomes the environment variable name in the Pod:
```bash
[...]
containers:
 - name: security-server-sidecar
   image: niis/xroad-security-server-sidecar:latest
   imagePullPolicy: "Always"
   envFrom:
   - secretRef:
     name: secret-sidecar-variables
[...]
```
